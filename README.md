#### Datapoints to the top left of the graph are classified as easy problems. These problems point models in the right direction, but provide little value when models are tested on harder problems. Datapoints on the bottom left are classified as hard problems and can be extremely challenging for even human annotators. It is not uncommon for this section of the data to contain wrong solutions. Datapoints that are highly variable are best for training models that generalize to out-of-distribution data.
